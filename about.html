<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
You can <b>contact me at neeldatay at gmail dot com</b>. I'll probably reply. I like to talk to new people and to renew good connections.
</p>
<p>
Born Oct 2001 in Pune, India.<br>
Home has always been Tokyo. I want to make the country of Japan my neighbourhood.<br> 
Ethnically Indian. Pune also has a faint connotation of home.<br>
Now to the important stuff.

<p>
I feel joy when my face is exposed to the elements; sunlight, cold, rain, or wind.<br>
I feel joy when I see a baby or toddler on the train or on the street.
</p>
<p>
Cold showers only.<br>
Summers over winters.<br>
I love mountains.<br>
I rarely take photos.<br>
I sleep around 9 hours a night.<br>
Minimalism.<br>
No flying. I had my experiences and am content for now.<br>
Walk where possible. Cycle next. Public transport after that. Drive last.<br>
I walk fast.<br>
I always take the stairs.<br>
I don't like giving or receiving gifts.<br>
I hate being in a rush.

<b>Words I am or try to be</b><br>
Some of these are antidotes to my nature.
<ul>
<li>free will. For me, and from me. Live and let live.</li>
<li>individualist. Maybe selfish. Not big on gifts and acts of service.</li>
<li>appreciative. I may do it with a straight face, but I always give sincere and meaningful compliments!</li>
<li>fair. I only expect what I offer.</li>
<li>amicable. Despite being intense at heart, I am gentle, and can hold a normal or silly conversation!</li>
<li>precise. Say exactly what you intend to. Sharpen your lingustic tools to keep up with your cognition.</li>
<li>memento mori. We are all temporary. Smile, don't complain, let little things go.</li>
<li>absurdist. We are insignificant on the planet. Worry little, celebrate little, dwell little.</li>
<li>minimalist. My sources of joy and excitement are pretty inexpensive.</li>
<li>concise. Minimalism with words.</li>
<li>process oriented. Dream, envision, then just stack days relentlessly.</li>
<li>positive. There is usually a way. Look for it.</li>
<li>athlete. First cricket, now running. Competitive outlet and vital to my confidence.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>Works in progress</b><br>
<ul>
<li>No screens without a specific purpose. Boredom is good.</li>
<li>Smiling more!</li>
<li>Complaining less.</li>
</ul>
