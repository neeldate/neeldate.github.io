<h1>Some more beliefs</h1>
<p>
I want to choose my environment.<br>
Sometimes, that environment will be conducive to excellence;<br>
sometimes, it won't.<br>
That's okay.<br>
<b>Unhosen excellence can lead to unhappiness.</b>
</p>
<p>
Deliberate discipline is worth its fickleness.<br>
I want the freedom to do nothing yet choose to do something good.<br>
I may have what feel like long phases of doing nothing.<br>
But "it's the silence between the notes that makes the music."<br>
Moreover, when faced with a major change that makes unproductivity non-optional,<br>
I'll still be happy.
</p>
<p>
<b>"Always tell the truth" has an important caveat.</b><br>
Each human has feedback that they respond better to.<br>
There are general principles that are valid for most of us.<br>
Most of us, including me, hold a core belief that productivity and grit are important.<br>
That is our truth.<br>
But when are stuck in a rut, most of us need to be told it is okay even if we do nothing.<br>
Strictly speaking, we need to be lied to.<br>
But this lie captures a fundamental truth, that we respond better to some false messages.
</p>
<p>
I am skeptical of categorising myself for the sake of simplicity of identity.<br>
That serves as a pigeonhole for future beliefs.<br>
It is possible to be equally passionate about ideas from two opposing schools of thought.<br>
Are you liberal or conservative? Open or private? Talkative or quiet?<br>
My answer is: yes. All that, and more.<br>
I am what I am, and there does not need to be a single word to encapsulate that complexity.<br>
That's one reason we have names.
</p>
<p>
Measure productivity on the scale of life.<br>
Play the long game.<br>
<b>Go slow to go far.</b><br>
So slow that you often feel lazy.<br>
Let joy be your guide for effort.
</p>
<p>
I dislike advice of the form<br>
"most people are such and such; don't be like most people; be better than them."<br>
Don't promote a divide between doers and non-doers of an activity.<br>
That fosters a false and toxic feeling of superiority.<br>
You are not better than anyone.<br>
Everyone has a story.
