<h1>Purpose of this website</h1>
<p>
I want some attention when I do something I'm proud of, but less than and different to that offered by social media.<br>
This website is a way to regulate that attention.<br>
If you'd like to get in touch, my email address is at the bottom of the homepage.
</p>
<p>
This website is an output of my slow thinking.<br>
When I am asked a question in a conversation, I often can't give an accurate and concise answer because doing so needs more thought.<br>
After having given careful thought to some real questions asked in past conversations, and some I made up myself, some answers live here.<br>
Maybe they'll be useful when I am asked the same questions again, whether in a casual conversation or in a high stakes one where such questions can be traps, like in interviews.
</p>
<p>
This website challenges me to introspect and convert the notions of my conclusions into words.<br>
I write better than I speak, so I want my real thoughts to be just as tangible as the ones I express via speech.
</p>
<p>
This website makes it easier to decide what I want to say yes and no to, because it is intended to serve as a reflection of my priorities.
