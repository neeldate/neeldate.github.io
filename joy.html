<h1>Make work joyful</h1>
<p>
You won't grit your way through joyless endeavours.<br>
If pursuing something is important, find a way to make it joyful.
</p>
<p>
Ask yourself what it would look like if it were fun.<br>
Most times, a simple tweak to the activity or your attitude does the trick.<br>
Other times, you'll find that the activity itself is not authentic to you, and you'll redirect your energy.
</p>
<p>
As you move forward in your pursuit of choice, make further occasional tweaks to keep the joy intact.<br>
That is how an interest becomes an obsession.<br>
No one can outwork the person that is having fun while doing it.
</p>
<h3>What If Work Was Fun?</h3>
<p>
If it's hot,<br>
feel hot<br>
while doing the work.<br>
If it's cold,<br>
feel cold<br>
while doing the work.<br>
If it's raining,<br>
get wet<br>
while doing the work.<br>
If it's joyless,<br>
Pause. Recalibrate.<br>
Rediscover the joy.<br>
one solved worry at a time.
