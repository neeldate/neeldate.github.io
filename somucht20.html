<h1>Why So Much T20?</h1>
<p>
Most international cricketers would agree that Test matches are the ultimate challenge.
Yet, the number of Test matches continues to drop.
Meanwhile, at any given time, at least one franchise T20 league seems to be going on somewhere in the world.
</p>
<h3>Why T20 Works</h3>
<p>
Teams in T20 leagues are commercially owned, so they can offer lucrative contracts.
So the best players come, and the quality of cricket is guaranteed to be high.
This makes T20 leagues a viable pathway to a player aspiring to make it into their national team.
And even if the player fails to make their national team, they still earn a handsome living.
</p>
<ul>
<li>T20 cricket fits around work hours.</li>
<li>T20 cricket is easy to understand.</li>
<li>T20 cricket is action-packed.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Watching a T20 match is fun even for a casual fan.
It can be made into a social event.
It is harder to make that case for a day of a Test match.  
</p>
<h3>Tests Still Players' Favourite</h3>
<p>
I maintain, however, that most players would say Tests are the pinnacle.
<ul>
<li>They would say that doing well in Test cricket would bring the most career satisfaction.</li>
<li>They would use deeper words to describe the beauty of Test cricket than they would use to describe T20.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
But pleasing the players is not of paramount importance.
</p>
<h3>The Hierarchy Of People To Please</h3>
<ol>
<li>Cricket watchers. They bring the money.</li>
<li>National cricket boards. They multiply the money.</li>
<li>Players. They love Tests, but like T20 too.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Message To Fellow Traditionalists</h3>
<p>
Fellow stubborn traditionalists that have fallen out of love with cricket because of the prevalence of T20s:<br> 
I think we are disappointed because we want players to be cricket's most important asset.
</p>
<p>
But cricket is moving in a different direction, and we must accept that this is still "cricket".
We are just no longer cricket fans.
We were.
