<h1>Some core beliefs</h1>
<p>
Beliefs need not be true.<br>
Beliefs may change at any time.
</p>
<p>
I am lucky.<br>
My life has been fair, perhaps even unfairly forgiving.<br>
Thank you, Nature.<br>
This may not be true for everyone, but <b>my happiness is my choice</b>.<br>
And choosing to be happy is <i>my</i> virtue.
</p>
<p>
The negative inner voice is a beautiful part of the human experience.<br>
Acknowledge it, smile, then transcend it.<br>
Fear is an indicator that you are walking a worthwhile path.<br>
<b>Do it despite the fear.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Productivity and grit are important.</b><br>
But this is not the message we need to hear when we have lost them.<br>
You can't summon the will to get stuff done through sheer force.<br>
At least not without significant side effects.<br>
A way to reintegrate productivity and grit into your identity:<br> 
convince yourself that they are not that important.<br>
Give yourself the permission to half ass.<br>
Find a way to get started.<br>
Once started, your proclivity for consistent hard work will win.
</p>
<p>
Just action is not enough.<br>
One needs action and intention.<br>
That is how you access the full package of benefits of the action.<br>
Do it for the right reasons.<br>
Getting your intentions in order will stall action temporarily, but that's the point.<br>
I'd rather move slowly to my destination than rapidly in the opposite direction.
</p>
<p>
If you want joy, go get it.<br>
Chasing joy is a useful approach to being happy;<br>
the Greek philosophy of <a href="https://dailyphilosopher.net/what-is-epicureanism/">Epicureanism</a> got it right.<br>
Paradoxically, voluntary discomfort is the most reliable way to craft joy.<br>
Stoicism and Epicureanism advocate for <a href="https://dailystoic.com/epicureanism-stoicism/">similar</a> lifestyles to different audiences.<br>
I resonate with both.
</p>
<p>
<b>Free will</b> is central to my value system.<br>
Simply following your whims will lead you along a virtuous path.<br>
Humans have a predisposition for good.<br>
Have faith that what you want will evolve into what you <i>want to want</i>.<br>
Some day, the noblest path will also be the path of least resistance.
