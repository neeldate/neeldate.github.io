<h1>Happiness is my duty but not a universal duty</h1>
<p>
I am lucky.<br>
My life has been fair, perhaps even unfairly forgiving.<br>
Thank you, Nature.<br>
This may not be true for everyone, but <b>my happiness is my choice</b>.<br>
And choosing to be happy is <i>my</i> virtue.
</p>
<p>
I must not judge others by my notions of virtue and vice.<br>
The only person you can be better than is the version of yourself that didn't choose the right option.<br>
Virtue exists. There is a right way to live.<br> 
But only personally, not globally.
</p>
<p>
Which compels me to restate: happiness is a virtuous choice <i>for me</i>.<br>
Seeking happiness is not a universal duty.<br>
This took years to understand, then accept.<br>
I believe one's access to happiness is determined by the amount of free will that one has.<br>
Since not everyone has equal free will, not everyone has equal access to <b>happiness</b>.<br>
However, <b>anyone can be happy.</b><br>
Who am I to tell someone their disadvantages impose an upper bound to their happiness?<br>
<b>Empower</b> the disadvantaged to overturn their reality <b>without burdening</b> them to do so.
