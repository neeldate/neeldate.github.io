<h1><a href="index.html">Neel Date</a></h1>
<h1>Sporting Background</h1>
<h3>2008 (age 6)</h3>
Able to cycle 20km.<br>
Swam twice a week.<br>
Mix of play and stamina building with my father on many weekends. 
<h3>2010</h3>
Able to cycle 50km in 3:30hrs.<br>
Swam once a week.<br>
Still out with my father on most weekends with good weather.<br>
Started playing cricket.<br>
Able to be active all day in hot and humid weather.<br>
Loved competing and trying hard.
<h3>2012</h3>
Climbed Mt. Fuji for first time.<br>
Still swimming once a week. Could swim 500m without stopping.
<h3>2013</h3>
First time distance running (2km race in 9:52).<br>
I could get into a rhythm and then running felt tolerable, even fun.
<h3>2014</h3>
Stopped swimming.<br>
Climbed Mt Fuji in cold, wind, and rain. Test of character.<br>
Ran every few months. No structure. Faster each time than the last.<br>
Enjoyed pushing myself and giving everything I had.
<h3>2016</h3>
Cricket on most weekends.<br>
Able to cycle 130km in around 8 hours.<br>
Able to run 21km.<br>
Became more self-motivated to train.
<h3>2017</h3>
Focused on cricket and began training in the offseason.
<h3>2018</h3>
Paid more attention to supplementary things such as diet, strength, speed, and stamina.<br> 
Ambition was to set the standard of skill, fitness, attitude, and professionalism for younger players.<br>
Ran every few weeks, mostly for challenging myself and learning to move fast while in some pain.<br>
<h3>2019</h3>
Training for U19 World Cup. Unsustainably intense but with a clear and important objective.<br>
Only two intensities in everything I did: hard and very hard.<br>
Pushing body close to its limit.<br>
<h3>Jan 2020 (age 18)</h3>
U19 World Cup. Peak of my cricket. Rewarding experience. Emotionally challenging but fulfilling.<br>
After the tournament was over, my initial emotion was fear that the peak of my cricket had come and gone.<br> 
I was even more afraid of how hard I would need to push myself to ensure that my best still lay ahead.<br>
Even so, I intended to put in the work over the next few years to take my cricket to the next level.<br>
But Covid-19 was just around the corner, and things were about to change.<br>
Over the next two years, I would become a runner. Cricket would exit my identity.
