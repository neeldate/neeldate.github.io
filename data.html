<h3>What is WRE (weekly run effect)?</h3>
It is my attempt at capturing the training effect of the combination of walking, trail running, and road running that I in to a single metric.<br>
Roughly, it is the distance that would have been run in a given week if all my running had been at a pace of 6min/km on flat roads.<br>
For a detailed explanation, read on.
<ul>
<li>We know walking and trail running count as aerobic training that is very specific to running.</li>
<li>But while doing a lot of walking and trail running, knowing how much I ran in a given month is not straightforward!</li>
<li>We seek to define a new metric (WRE) that allows comparison of training load from month to month.</li>
<li>Define grade adjusted distance as the distance plus 1km for every 120m of elevation gain.</li>
<li>GAP (grade adjusted pace) is the pace (in min/km) corresponding to the grade adjusted distance.</li>
<li>GAP allows us to compare paces across months.</li>
<li>We would also like to account for the greater training effectiveness of faster paces.</li>
<li>Assume training effectiveness increases linearly with speed (double the speed has double the effect).</li>
<li>For example, 1km run in 3 minutes is as effective as 2km run in 6 minutes.</li>
<li>Define a RE (run effect) point as the training effect of running 1km in 6 minutes.</li>
<li>Therefore, a  kilometre run in 3 minutes will receive 2 RE points, as will 2km run in 24min (at 12min/km).</li>
<li>We use this relationship to compute how many RE points were accumulated in a given month.</li>
<li>WRE (weekly run effect) is the average number of points accumulated during any given week in a given month.</li>
<li>WRE standardises the training effect of running fast, running slow, walking, and trail running.</li>
<li>WRE represents how many kilometres I would have run every week if all I did is run at a steady pace of 6min/km on flat roads.</li>
<li>We can now directly compare training load between different months by comparing their WREs.</li>
<li>Pretty useful, isn't it? :)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Notes on walking</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Walk km" refers to distance of purposeful walking without racewalking technique for low end aerobic stimulus and long distance training.</li> 
<li>Indoor walking, short outdoor chores, and commutes are not included.</li>
<li>Walking is probably the most transferrable exercise to running, especially training for events that last 6+ hours.</li>
<li>I usually walk at a pace of around 9:00min/km on flat roads.</li>
<li>Casual social hiking is included in "Walk km" instead of "Trail run km". Slow social walking is omitted entirely.</li>
</ul>
